## Quick Fix for "Page Not Found" Error

If you're seeing a "Page not found" error on Netlify, follow these steps:

## Method 1: Manual Upload (Recommended)

1. **Build the project locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Go to Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Visit [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Find your site (`orionmy`)

3. **Manual Deploy:**
   - Go to "Deploys" tab
   - Drag and drop the `dist` folder from your local project
   - Wait for upload to complete

4. **Your site should now work!**

## Method 2: Fix Build Settings

1. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Go to "Site settings" â†’ "Build & deploy"
   - Under "Build settings":
     - Build command: `npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Under "Environment variables":
     - Add: `NODE_VERSION` = `18`

2. **Trigger New Deploy:**
   - Go to "Deploys" tab
   - Click "Trigger deploy" â†’ "Deploy site"

## Method 3: Connect GitHub Repository

1. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose GitHub
   - Select your `ORION2025` repository

2. **Build Settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Click "Deploy site"

## Troubleshooting

### If still getting "Page not found":

1. **Check the deploy log:**
   - Go to "Deploys" tab
   - Click on the latest deploy
   - Check for build errors

2. **Verify files:**
   - The `dist` folder should contain:
     - `index.html`
     - `_redirects`
     - `assets/` folder with CSS and JS files

3. **Clear cache:**
   - In Netlify dashboard, go to "Deploys"
   - Click "Clear cache and deploy site"

## Expected Result

After successful deployment, you should see:
- âœ… Loading spinner
- âœ… "DEMO MODE" banner
- âœ… Auto-login with sample data
- âœ… Project dashboard with 3 sample projects
- âœ… Full functionality without backend setup

## Alternative: Use Vercel

If Netlify continues to have issues:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

Vercel often handles React SPAs better out of the box.
